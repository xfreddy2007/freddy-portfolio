## Why React

From doing such React courses I try to do a whole new project with React framework, and firt comes to this portfolio in my mind.  React is a widely use framework and has a huge Ecosystem, active community, and high performance. It helps developers to be easier to manage UI states across entire application, and focus on the business logics.

## Why Taiwindcss

CSS libraries are well known as clean, standard and also have some pre-built animations or components inside the libraries. There are many CSS libraries in the development environment such as Bootstrap, tachyons, etc. I choose to use Taiwindcss because it has a good standard and small bundled file size. In addition, some CSS preprocessor are already implemented and do some autoprefix in order to avoid class naming crash between other libraries or custom defined CSS.

## Main Challenge

Actually this project was built without React framework initially. My purpose is to learn Webpack throughout this project. From end-to-end settings with the .config files, learn how to set rules for different files, add plugins to minify files and images, and so on and so forth. These process gives me an overview of how Webpack is working, cause we use `create-react-app` command to initialize the starting state of a project, but not to understand what is behind the scence.

## Where to go from here

This is my first exclusive project from end to end. I am glad I can utilize the techniques I've learned thoughout all the course. Implementing techniques are not very hard but to have an awesome idea about another new project that stands out is a advanced skill, and I am walking towrad this direction. Let's wait for next interesting project to be built.
